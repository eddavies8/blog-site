W﻿e travelled to Copenhagen, it was more beautiful and peaceful than anywhere else I've been. If you have high expectations for visiting, keep them high and it will exceed them.

W﻿e got the train out to the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art and saw the Alex De Corte exhibition, the art was unsettling and thoughtful.
