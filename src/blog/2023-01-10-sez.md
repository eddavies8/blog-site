T﻿his is my favourite photo I've ever taken.\
\
I﻿t was a really hot day in August and to stay cool I perched on the windowsill of our flat. I was playing with my camera and then Sarah poked her head out of the window, I turned around and took a shot. Like all the best things it happened organically and naturally.

I love the tips of the sky in her eyes and the film grain mixing with the freckles on her shoulder. It's rare to capture a portrait of someone that incapsulates deeply who they are, it's even more special when it's of someone you love.\

I shot this with an Olympus XA on ILFORD HP5.
