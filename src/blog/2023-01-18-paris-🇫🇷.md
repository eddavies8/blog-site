For my birthday we went to [Camille](https://camille-restaurant.com/) and it was perfect, we had Escargots de bourgogne (Burgundy snails), Entrecôte Grillée, Beurre Maître D'hôtel, Frites maison (Beef ribeye, beurre Maître d’hôtel, homemade French fries), Créme Brûlée Maison (Homemade crème brûlée), Crumble Aux Pommes Maison (Homemade Apple Crumble), Espresso and wine. 🍷
